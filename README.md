px0 is an IDE built for reviewing AI-generated code, optimized for speed. It turns your browser into a zero-latency console with native Git and GitHub integrations, instant search across massive codebases, and seamless handoff to local AI coding harnesses.

As AI agents author more code directly from the terminal, engineering productivity is no longer constrained by how fast you type - it is constrained by how fast you can review, navigate, and verify changes. px0 replaces heavy, multi-gigabyte editing suites with an instant, distraction-free environment built specifically for this review loop.

- < 1 ms cold start
- ~20–30 MB server daemon RAM (~100–180 MB total with browser tab, vs. VS Code's ~1,440 MB)
- Single static Go binary with zero runtime dependencies (no Electron, no Node, no CGO)
- ~280 languages tokenized natively via Chroma

See full performance benchmarks and comparisons at [px0.ai/benchmarks](https://px0.ai/benchmarks).

## Features

- GitHub PR reviews & Git panel: Review pull requests directly (`px0 <pr-url>`), inspect scoped merge-base diffs, draft inline review comments, and stage, commit, or push from the browser.
- Claude session bridge: `-bridge <name>` sends comments and chat to a Claude Code session already running in your terminal, and shows its replies, without posting anything to GitHub.
- Unpushed commit review: Read the commits your branch is ahead of its tracking branch by, one file diff at a time, before you push them.
- AI coding harness integration: Dispatch edits directly to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor Agent, Antigravity, OpenCode, Codex, Aider, or Goose with live reloading.
- Fast navigation: Fuzzy file search, symbol outline, and workspace regex search in milliseconds.
- Remote-first: Run on any remote server, VM, or container and browse locally without SSH key setups or remote daemons.
- Virtual rendering: Opens 400,000-line files smoothly by mounting only visible rows; frees memory back to the OS after 15 seconds of inactivity.
- Rich code viewer: 14 built-in themes, rendered Markdown preview, CSV/TSV table view, image inspector, and optional zero-config LSP for Go-to-Definition and hover.

## Installation

Quick install (macOS, Linux, BSD):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://px0.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Build from source (requires Go 1.24+ and Node.js or Bun):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/px0-ai/px0.git
cd px0
make build
install -d ~/.local/bin && install px0 ~/.local/bin/
```

To update an existing installation:

```bash
px0 --update
```

## Usage

```bash
# Inspect current directory
px0

# Inspect a specific directory or file
px0 ~/workspace/project
px0 main.go:42

# Review a GitHub pull request
px0 https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Remote or headless server mode
px0 -host 0.0.0.0 -port 7777 ~/workspace

# Behind a reverse proxy under a subpath
px0 -base-path /rev-123/ -host 0.0.0.0 -port 7777 ~/workspace

# Talk to a Claude Code session you already have open (comments stay local)
px0 -bridge review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

`-bridge <name>` (or `-bridge auto`, named after the repo or PR) connects
px0 to an already running Claude Code session through
`~/.px0/bridge/<name>/inbox.jsonl` and `outbox.jsonl`. px0 prints both paths
and an instruction to paste into the session. After that, comments
(`Alt+K`, or **Send to Claude** in a PR review) and messages from the
**Claude** pane go to that session, and its replies appear under them. Nothing
sent this way is posted to GitHub. Posting to GitHub is a separate button
labelled "on GitHub". See [Claude Session Bridge](docs/features/claude-bridge.md).

When px0 binds to `0.0.0.0`, it prints a `network` URL for every unique
non-loopback IPv4 address on the machine, using the port selected by the
listener:

```text
  url:        http://0.0.0.0:7777
  network:    http://10.0.0.15:7777
  network:    http://192.168.1.42:7777
```

Open the address that is reachable from your local machine. The list can
include LAN, VPN, and container-network addresses, depending on the remote
host's interfaces.

Access securely over Tailscale, WireGuard, reverse proxy, or Cloudflare Tunnel
with zero remote setup overhead and strict read-only sandboxing
(path traversal protection & DNS rebinding checks).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/px0-ai/px0.git
cd px0

# Run tests
make test

# Live frontend development (serves web/ assets directly from disk)
go run . -dev .

# Build binary
make build
```

## Benchmarks

```bash
# Clone the benchmark corpus (~3 GB: Linux, Kubernetes, TypeScript, etc.)
./benchmark.sh --clone

# Run benchmarks across the corpus
./benchmark.sh

# Compare px0 directly against VS Code on the current workspace
./benchmark.sh --vscode .

# Profile memory lifecycle (index, search, idle memory release)
./benchmark.sh --memory bench-repos/linux
```

> **Architecture & Memory Accounting**: px0 separates the lightweight native Go daemon from the browser-rendered UI. The Go server consumes ~20–30 MB resident RAM (RSS). The active browser tab allocates ~80–150 MB for DOM nodes, V8 JS runtime, and GPU compositing. Combined, the total local memory footprint is ~100–180 MB (~85–90% lighter than Electron IDEs like VS Code at ~1,440 MB, which bundle dedicated Chromium and Node runtimes). In remote or container environments (`px0 -host 0.0.0.0`), the remote host pays strictly the ~20–30 MB server cost. See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for full methodology and breakdowns.

## Design Partners

When AI coding agents generate large diffs across repositories every day, code authoring is no longer the bottleneck. Verification and review are.

We are looking for engineering teams (10+ engineers or teams running active agent workflows) as design partners. Partners receive direct Slack Connect access to the core team, rapid turnaround on custom harness integrations, and direct input on the roadmap.

Learn more on the [Design Partners page](https://px0.ai/design-partners).
